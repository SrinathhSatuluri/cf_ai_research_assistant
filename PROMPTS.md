# AI Development Prompts

This document contains AI prompts used during development to assist with code generation and best practices.

## Project Setup and Architecture

**Prompt**: "Help me structure a Cloudflare Workers project with Durable Objects. What's the recommended directory structure and configuration for a TypeScript-based AI application?"

**Prompt**: "What are the best practices for organizing Durable Object methods for session management? Should I separate concerns or keep everything in one class?"

**Prompt**: "Generate boilerplate TypeScript interfaces for a chat application with sessions and messages. Include proper typing for timestamps and user roles."

## Code Generation and Boilerplate

**Prompt**: "Generate basic HTML structure for a chat interface with sidebar. Focus on semantic HTML without styling."

**Prompt**: "Create CSS utility classes for a modern glassmorphism design system. Include variables for colors, spacing, and common effects."

**Prompt**: "Generate TypeScript utility functions for date formatting and time calculations (time ago, relative dates)."

**Prompt**: "Create boilerplate API endpoint handlers for CRUD operations on chat sessions. Include proper error handling patterns."

## Best Practices and Optimization

**Prompt**: "What are the security best practices for handling user input in Cloudflare Workers? How should I sanitize and validate chat messages?"

**Prompt**: "How should I structure error handling in a Durable Object to ensure consistency across all methods?"

**Prompt**: "What's the recommended pattern for handling concurrent requests to the same Durable Object instance?"

**Prompt**: "Generate clean, maintainable JavaScript patterns for managing application state without external frameworks."

## Performance and Scalability

**Prompt**: "What are the performance considerations when storing large amounts of chat history in Durable Objects? How should I implement pagination?"

**Prompt**: "How do I optimize Cloudflare Workers AI requests to minimize latency and costs?"

**Prompt**: "Generate efficient JavaScript code for managing DOM updates in a chat interface without causing layout thrashing."

## Testing and Debugging

**Prompt**: "What's the best approach for testing Durable Objects locally? Generate example test patterns for session management."

**Prompt**: "Create debugging utilities for logging Durable Object state changes during development."

## Code Quality and Standards

**Prompt**: "Review this TypeScript configuration and suggest improvements for strict type checking in a Cloudflare Workers environment."

**Prompt**: "Generate ESLint rules appropriate for a TypeScript Cloudflare Workers project with focus on performance and maintainability."

**Prompt**: "What are the TypeScript best practices for async/await error handling in Worker environments?"

## Documentation

**Prompt**: "Generate JSDoc comments for Durable Object methods that handle session management and message persistence."

**Prompt**: "Create clear API documentation structure for RESTful endpoints in a Workers application."

These prompts were used to generate boilerplate code, establish best practices, and ensure proper TypeScript patterns throughout the development process. The core application logic, business requirements, and architectural decisions were implemented independently.
